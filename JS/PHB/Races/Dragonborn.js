  "<b>Languages:</b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.",
  "<b>Breath Weapon:</b> You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in a shape determined by your colour must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your colour, (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). A creature takes 2d6 damage of a type determined by your colour on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest."
